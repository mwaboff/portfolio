    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">Intro</h3>
    <p>I have used and made user scripts for almost a decade and they have been a big part of <a href="../projects/hfes.html">my growth as a developer</a>. When deciding on my Master's thesis, I was excited to research and build something that could help the community.</p>

    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">What are User Scripts?</h3>
    <p>User scripts are small cross-browser add-ons that can be used to enhance a user’s web browsing experience. These scripts are used to provide quick and unique customizations that directly modify the website a user is visiting. Created by the community, user scripts can add features ranging from adding detailed summary information from a review website into a favorite video streaming service to replacing all images with pictures of cats.</p>

    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">The Problem</h3>
    <p>The growth of the user script community has stagnated over the past 10 years as official browser extensions have gained popularity instead.</p>
    <div class="case-study__images">
      <img src="../media/projects/monkeyscripts/google_trends_userscript_userscripts_user-script_user-scripts.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>After interviewing technical and non-technical people of whom some were aware of what user scripts are, I realized there are two core problems:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>User Aquisition:</b> There are no easy to follow and understand explanations of what user scripts are and how to use them in a way that resonates with non technical users. To solve this I built an interactive tutorial that uses modern adult learning techniques, not something ever done in the user script community before.</li>
      <li><b>User Retention:</b> To convince a user to try to learn, you have to provide obvious motivation as to why they would want to stay. To solve this, I built a collaborative filter recommendation system to provide relevant, personalized results.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">User Aquisition - Interactive Tutorial</h3>
    <p>To prepare for this project, I heavily researched how people learn complicated topics. Focusing on adult learning techniques, I found there are a few tips that can be used to determine what is going on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the lesson concise.</li>
      <li>Let users practice what they are taught.</li>
      <li>Use rewards as motivation.</li>
      <li>Accommodate the three different learning styles: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To teach users, I created a tutorial that accommodated each of these above steps. First I broke instructions down to 2 steps: 1) Installing the tool needed for user scripts to work; 2) finding and installing scripts. For the first, the instructions for installing the script are provided to the user in the form of a video, as well as written. For the second, I developed a test user script that will immediately provide positive feedback as soon as it's installed. These two easy steps provide a modern method of teaching users how to find and use user scripts compared to the wall-of-text solutions from previous </p>

    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">User Retention - Recommendation System</h3>
    <p>Other user script hosting sites only provide a few simple methods of discovering new scripts: search, a top download list, and a list sorted by top raiting. As their collection of scripts grew really large, it would result in it being difficult to find any script that matters to the user. To fight this I looked to </p>
