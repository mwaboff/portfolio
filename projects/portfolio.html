    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">Intro</h3>
    <p>"First Impressions Last." With this fridge magnet wisdom in mind, I have been in a constant quest to develop and improve my portfolio to reflect who I am and my current skill level. Wanting to take advantage of the new tools and techniques I've learned while pursuing my Masters degree, I decided give it another shot.</p>
    <div class="case-study__images">

    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">Previous Designs</h3>
    <h5>v 1.0</h5>
    <p>In 2014, design was a secondary concern for me. Mobile responsiveness was not even a passing thought, and we can see this directly reflected in my original designs.</p>
    <div class="case-study__images">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/orig_portfolio_1.png">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/orig_portfolio_2.png">
    </div>
    <p>I did not know, or respect, the amount of effort that needed to go into the pre-development design work. A couple years later, I decided to tackle it again.</p>
    <h5>v 2.0</h5>
    <p>Doing a lot of research this time, I thought I figured out what made a good portfolio: breaking the page into multiple sections and adding ample amount of whitespace. Again, I decided to build and design the site without the necessary preparation or taking responsiveness into account.</p>
    <div class="case-study__images">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/second_portfolio_1.png">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/second_portfolio_2.png">
    </div>
    <p>As you can see above, aligning components became a real struggle for me, but in my stubberness, I refused to use tools such as bootstrap for assistance.</p>
    <p>This page was important as my first foray into using Django, a Python MVC framework. I used this new knowledge for multiple projects down the line.</p>
    <h5>v 3.0</h5>
    <p>Flash forward to 2020 and I decided to approach my site design again as my final project for this semester's class. By now, I had learned many tools and techniques, such as flexbox, grid, and media queries.</p>
    <div class="case-study__images">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/third_portfolio_1.png">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/third_portfolio_2.png">
    </div>
    <p>With this version, I was considerably happier with the front-end code. Using generous application of flex boxes and grids, I built a fun and bold portfolio.</p>
    <p>After creating the initial desktop design, I started working on the responsiveness. I quickly realized the website was getting out of my control and felt overwhelming. I had a couple weeks left before my class was done and decided I should take the time to do this correct.</p>


    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">Design</h3>
    <p>Before writing a single line of code on my latest version, I committed myself to these two rules: <br>1. Create a wireframe and/or full mockup of any page before writing a single line of code.<br>2. Design and develop for the mobile view first.</p>
    <p>I chose two tools I had some experience with previously. First, I selected Balsamiq, an easy to use wireframing tool that focuses the user on only the layout of the site. For my mockups, I selected Figma, a popular tool in the industry.</p>
    <div class="case-study__images">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/wireframe_cover.png">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/wireframe_case_study.png">
    </div>
    <div class="case-study__images">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/mockup_mobile_cover.png">
      <img src="../media/projects/portfolio/mockup_desktop_cover.png">
    </div>
    <p>With these designs in place, the implementation of the site itself went very quickly. Whenever I had an issue or felt I was losing control of the design, it was easy to check the mockup and re-orient myself.</p>
    <p>In the end, the mobile-first approach and the design-first rules worked out very well and left me with a manageable design that was straight forward to implmement.</p>
    
    <h3 class="h3 case-study__section-title">Takeaways</h3>
    <p>1. Always start front-end design with a wireframe and mockup.</p>
    <p>2. Flex boxes and CSS variables are life savers.</p>
